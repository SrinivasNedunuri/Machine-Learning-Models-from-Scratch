# Machine-Learning-Models-from-Scratch
Implementing KNN, Random Forests, PCA algorithms from scratch. Also includes K means clustering, accuracy, recall, precision, within cluster sum of squares 

# Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a predictive analytics algorithm from scratch and to create a Scikit-learn predictive analytics pipeline and perform visualization using Matplotlib.
The implementation uses only NumPy and Pandas as external libraries

# The python file contain the following:
● Function implementing K-NearestNeighbour algorithm  
● Function implementing Random Forest   
● Function implementing PCA  
● Function implementing K-Means Clustering   
● Function for Accuracy   
● Function for Recall  
● Function for Precision  
● Function for Within Cluster sum of squares  

# Scikit-Learn Pipeline for Machine Learning
● Implementation of supervised algorithms SVM, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, using Scikit-learn and report accuracy   
● Creating an ensemble model using the voting classifier of the above-mentioned algorithms and report accuracy  
● Creating visualizations using Matplotlib library for the confusion matrix of each model (using subplot)   
● Perform Grid search on hyperparameters of SVM, Decision Tree and KNN and create plots using Matplotlib  

# Dataset:-
The data has 48 features and the last column corresponds to the label.
